# Dark World

An idle game made with Phaser 3. Theres probably a bunch of stuff I'm missing here.

### Requirements

We need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts.

## Install and run

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |
